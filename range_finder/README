| Daisy Shell
-------------------------
This is a simple shell that shows off how to use CmdMessenger to control the Daisy.
I think it just toggles the visible LED on/off with a command.  The can use it as
a skeleton for a new project to get started quickly.

$ cp Makefile.sample Makefile
$ vi Makefile 
	(edit for your environment)
$ make
$ make upload

Make sure you read ../README.txt to understand the build process.
